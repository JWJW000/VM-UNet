## Abstract
In the realm of medical image segmentation, both CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been extensively explored. However, CNNs exhibit limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, whereas Transformers are hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, have emerged as a promising approach. They not only excel in modeling long-range interactions but also maintain a linear computational complexity. In this paper, leveraging state space models, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Vision Mamba UNet (VM-UNet). Specifically, the Visual State Space (VSS) block is introduced as the foundation block to capture extensive contextual information, and an asymmetrical encoder-decoder structure is constructed. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, and Synapse datasets, and the results indicate that VM-UNet performs competitively in medical image segmentation tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first medical image segmentation model constructed based on the pure SSM-based model. We aim to establish a baseline and provide valuable insights for the future development of more efficient and effective SSM-based segmentation systems.

## 1. Prepare the dataset

### ISIC datasets
- The ISIC17 and ISIC18 datasets, divided into a 7:3 ratio, can be found here {[Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Y0YupaH21yDN5uldl7IcZA?pwd=dybm)}. 

- After downloading the datasets, you are supposed to put them into './data/isic17/' and './data/isic18/', and the file format reference is as follows. (take the ISIC17 dataset as an example.)

- './data/isic17/'
  - train
    - images
      - .png
    - masks
      - .png
  - val
    - images
      - .png
    - masks
      - .png

### Synapse datasets

- For the Synapse dataset, you could follow [Swin-UNet](https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet) to download the dataset, or you could download them from {[Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JCXBfRL9y1cjfJUKtbEhiQ?pwd=9jti)}.

- After downloading the datasets, you are supposed to put them into './data/Synapse/', and the file format reference is as follows.

- './data/Synapse/'
  - lists
    - list_Synapse
      - all.lst
      - test_vol.txt
      - train.txt
  - test_vol_h5
    - casexxxx.npy.h5
  - train_npz
    - casexxxx_slicexxx.npz

## 2. Prepare the pre_trained weights

- The weights of the pre-trained VMamba could be downloaded from [Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ci_YvPPEiUT2bIIK5x8Igw?pwd=wnyy) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZJjc7sdyd-6KfI7c8R6rDN8bcTz3QkCx?usp=sharing). After that, the pre-trained weights should be stored in './pretrained_weights/'.



## 3. Train the VM-UNet
```bash
cd VM-UNet
python train.py  # Train and test VM-UNet on the ISIC17 or ISIC18 dataset.
python train_synapse.py  # Train and test VM-UNet on the Synapse dataset.
```

## 3.1 Scan-aware semi-supervised VM-UNet (main thesis line)

后续实验、消融、Go/No-Go 和写作排期见 **[docs/后续研究路线.md](docs/后续研究路线.md)**。

This is the **scan-aware SSL** protocol: EMA teacher uses all 4 Cross-Scan directions; the student drops 2 directions on unlabeled images; a complementary 2-dir student view adds direction consistency. Splits are frozen under `./splits/` so labeled sets are not reshuffled.

```bash
# 10% labeled on ISIC18 (default). Also run 0.05 and 0.2.
python train_ssl.py --labeled_ratio 0.1 --datasets isic18 --gpu 0

# Ablations
python train_ssl.py --labeled_ratio 0.1 --no_dir_consistency
python train_ssl.py --labeled_ratio 0.1 --no_scan_dropout

# Cross-domain: train on ISIC18, test on ISIC17 val (source normalization)
python eval_cross_domain.py \
  --ckpt results/<run>/checkpoints/best-epoch*-loss*.pth \
  --source isic18 --target isic17
```

Unit tests (no GPU, no `mamba_ssm`):

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_scan_utils.py tests/test_ssl_split.py
```

**NOTE**: If you want to use the trained checkpoint for inference testing only and save the corresponding test images, you can follow these steps:  

- **In `config_setting`**:  
   - Set the parameter `only_test_and_save_figs` to `True`.  
   - Fill in the path of the trained checkpoint in `best_ckpt_path`.  
   - Specify the save path for test images in `img_save_path`.  

- **Execute the script**:  
   After setting the above parameters, you can run `train.py`.

## 4. Obtain the outputs
- After trianing, you could obtain the results in './results/'

## 5. Trained VM-UNet Checkpoint

- You can also obtain our trained VM-UNet on ISIC17, ISIC18 and Synapse from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lygUOFo6fMF_wS_dskwpBQ?pwd=5z00) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZJjc7sdyd-6KfI7c8R6rDN8bcTz3QkCx?usp=sharing).
